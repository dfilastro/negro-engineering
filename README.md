# Projeto Pessoal

Created for my own company, developed in NextJS, using TypeScript.
Besides, I've integrated the projects pages list with Prismic CMS, to turn the process of including a new project easy.
Also, I've developed some cool features like Google Map Integration, to show where we are and where we've done our projects, and header that "shrinks" when the user rolls down the page.
Last but not less important, I've deployed using Vercel.
